I think you did write your blog very clear and very easy to understand, I really like it, I think Q1 is totally fine but there are some questions I want to ask question about Q2 you have mentioned that we can use different methods to capture human brain and apply the Fourier Transform to the wave but actually how to do so What is the formula or equation for this And after Fourier Transform what information can we get for human cognition what can we proof from this For Q3 you directly capture a paper content to here I think there are some unknown that you didn’t mention but I think it have mentioned in the paper and also I think you should write in your own word after reading the paper instead of put the whole part of other’s paper However there are some question want to ask you about Q3 also after we do the Fourier Transform in different users’ activities, what can we get What is the meaning of those number The frequency high means what? What information we can get from those formula By the way I think your blog really good I think you do a lot of research for it I see you do very hard Hithen may i know more about relationship between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy i understand thermodynamic entropy well but not really sure about on information entropyThanksThis post explains details on Gibbs free energy such as the limitation of using this theorem and what are the meaning behind the values e.g. delta H I am surprised that free energy is related to aging and the development of the brain However I think more detailed examples can be given on Q.3 so that it is easier for the audience to understand the concept
